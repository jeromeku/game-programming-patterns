<p>^title Decoupling Patterns</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of a programming language, writing code to do what you want is actually pretty easy. What's hard is writing code that's easy to adapt when your requirements <em>change</em>. Rarely do we have the luxury of a perfect feature set before we've fired up our editor.</p>
<p>A powerful tool we have for making change easier is <em>decoupling</em>. When we say two pieces of code are &quot;decoupled&quot;, we mean a change in one usually doesn't require a change in the other. When you change some feature in your game, the fewer places in code you have to touch, the easier it is.</p>
<p><a href="component.html">Components</a> decouple different domains in your game from each other within a single entity that has aspects of all of them. <a href="event-queue.html">Event Queues</a> decouple two objects communicating with each other, both statically and <em>in time</em>. <a href="service-locator.html">Service Locators</a> let code access a facility without being bound to the code that provides it.</p>
