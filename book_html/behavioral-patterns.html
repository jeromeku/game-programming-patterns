<p>^title Behavioral Patterns</p>
<p>Once you've built your game's set and festooned it with actors and props, all that remains is to start the scene. For this, you need behavior -- the screenplay that tells each entity in your game what to do.</p>
<p>Of course all code is &quot;behavior&quot;, and all software is defining behavior, but what's different about games is often the <em>breadth</em> of it that you have to implement. While your word processor may have a long list of features, it pales in comparison with the number of inhabitants, items, and quests in your average role-playing game.</p>
<p>The patterns in this chapter help to quickly define and refine a large quantity of maintainable behavior. <a href="type-object.html">Type Objects</a> create categories of behavior without the rigidity of defining an actual class. A <a href="subclass-sandbox.html">Subclass Sandbox</a> gives you a safe set of primitives you can use to define a variety of behaviors. The most advanced option is <a href="bytecode.html">Bytecode</a>, which moves behavior out of code entirely and into data.</p>
