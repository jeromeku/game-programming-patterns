<p>^title Sequencing Patterns</p>
<p>Videogames are exciting in large part because they take us somewhere else. For a few minutes (or, let's be honest with ourselves, much longer), we become inhabitants of a virtual world. Creating these worlds is one of the supreme delights of being a game programmer.</p>
<p>One aspect that most of these game worlds feature is <em>time</em> -- the artificial world lives and breathes at its own cadence. As world builders, we must invent time and craft the gears that drive our game's great clock.</p>
<p>The patterns in this section are tools for doing just that. A <a href="game-loop.html">Game Loop</a> is the central axle that the clock spins on. Objects hear its ticking through <a href="update-method.html">Update Methods</a>. We can hide the computer's sequential nature behind a facade of snapshots of moments in time using <a href="double-buffer.html">Double Buffering</a> so that the world appears to update simultaneously.</p>
